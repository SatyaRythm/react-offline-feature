# Comprehensive Offline Capability for Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Objective

Enhance the existing Progressive Web App (PWA) to support full offline capabilities, enabling users to seamlessly add, view, edit, and delete data even without an internet connection. All data changes performed offline should persist across app reloads, ensuring consistent state. When connectivity is restored, local changes should automatically synchronize with the backend server, with intelligent conflict resolution.

## Requirements

### 1. Offline Data Persistence
- Implement robust client-side storage using IndexedDB
- Support complete data persistence across refreshes, browser restarts, and device reboots
- Track synchronization status for each record (synced, created, updated, deleted)
- Generate temporary IDs for new records created while offline

### 2. CRUD Operations Offline
- Enable full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations regardless of connectivity
- Provide immediate UI feedback for all operations
- Display visual indicators for locally-stored records that haven't synced yet
- Maintain data consistency between offline and online states

### 3. Connectivity Monitoring
- Implement real-time connectivity detection
- Provide clear visual indicators of current connection status
- Display appropriate alerts when transitioning between online and offline states
- Show pending sync operations count when back online

### 4. Automatic Synchronization
- Trigger synchronization automatically when connectivity is restored
- Maintain a sync queue for tracking operations that need to be sent to server
- Implement retry logic for failed sync operations
- Provide manual sync option for user-initiated synchronization

### 5. Conflict Resolution
- Implement timestamp-based conflict resolution strategy
- Prioritize local changes when conflicts occur
- Handle ID reconciliation for records created offline
- Preserve relational integrity between related records

### 6. Service Worker Enhancement
- Configure service worker for advanced caching strategies
- Implement offline page fallbacks for navigation
- Cache necessary assets for complete offline functionality
- Support background sync API

### 7. User Experience
- Show clear indicators for offline mode
- Display badges for locally stored/unsynced records
- Provide non-blocking alerts for connectivity changes
- Maintain consistency in UI regardless of connection state

## Implementation Scope
Focus on implementing offline capabilities for these entities first:
- Accounts (companies/organizations)
- Contacts (people associated with accounts)

## Technical Components
1. IndexedDB database with defined schema
2. Service worker with workbox integration
3. Connectivity service for network status management
4. Offline-enhanced API layer that works with/without connectivity
5. Background sync implementation
6. UI components for status indication
7. Comprehensive error handling

## Success Criteria
- Users can create, view, edit, delete data when offline
- Changes persist across app restarts and browser refreshes
- All offline changes sync automatically when connectivity returns
- Clear visual feedback provided throughout the offline/online experience
